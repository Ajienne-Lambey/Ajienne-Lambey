## 🌟 About Me
I’m a **UX Researcher and Entrepreneur** passionate about creating ethical, user-centered tech experiences.  

I'm the founder of **Anchor Path**, a startup developing a **safe navigation app for kids and parents**, inspired by my original hackathon project **SafeRoutes**—designed to offer safe havens and build B2B social impact through school and community networks.  

I combine **UX/UI design, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and AWS cloud services** to create scalable, meaningful solutions that protect communities.

Outside of tech, I write and perform music at open mics, mentor students in life planning & tech building, and am preparing to publish my music to streaming platforms.
